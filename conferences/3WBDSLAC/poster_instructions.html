            <h3 class="center">Poster</h3>
            <p>Participants must create a 46 cm x 53 cm high-resolution image with all the poster information in English, 
                using as background the image <a download href="assets/img/poster_background.png" title="Poster Background" class="dark-purple">provided</a> 
                by the organizing committee. The poster should be in png format. The file 
                should be named with the last name of the first author and the EasyChair submission number: 
                “Velez_Rueda_Poster5.png”. To clearly explain your work to a broad technical audience, we recommend the following
                content for the poster: Title, Author list, Affiliation, and the Abstract: Background, Objectives, Methods
                or Techniques, Results, Conclusions. Here you can take a look at an example of a poster created with the background provided:

            <h3 class="center">Video</h3>
            <p >It is mandatory that authors also send the pre-record of their poster talk (3-5 minutes), which will be
                uploaded on our Youtube Channel and will be presented on our website along with the poster. The video 
                should preferably be in English, but participants can speak in their mother tongue and add English 
                subtitles. Save your presentation as an MP4 file. The file should be named with the last name of the 
                first author and the EasyChair submission number: “Velez_Rueda_Poster5.mp4”.</p>
            
            <h3 class="center">Twitter</h3>
            <p >Participants can also post their posters on Twitter at the beginning of the conference using a single tweet 
                with the poster image and a brief explanation. In order to increase the visibility and associate it with the 
                conference, please use the hashtags #VirtualPostersSession and #3WBDS_LA. Please use the handle @WBDSLA as well 
                so that we will receive a notification.</p>
            <p>Other suggestions for hashtags are #Bioinformatics #DataScience #WomenInSTEM or the topics of the conference as:
                #GenesGenomics #RNATranscriptomics #PhylogenyEvolution #ProteinsProteomics #BiomolecularSimulations
                #StructuralBioinformatics #Chemoinformatics #DrugDiscovery #MachineLearning
                #DataMining #BigData #SystemsBiology #Bioinformatics&Diseases #Database #SoftwareDevelopment #Education.</p>
            <p>If the poster is associated with a preprint/publication, we advise you to post a second tweet with 
                its url. In case you are in a country that does not allow Twitter posting, please send it to the official email 
                account before the 10th of September and we will post it for you.</p>
